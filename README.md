The level of a dam is quite frequently changing and we'd like to be able to model this in such a way that we can reliably know the height of the water in the dam as time progresses.
To do this the statistical programming package R will be used to compute, height, area, and volume of the dam.
As one might expect, the maximum amount of water in our dam will depend on the height. The maximum of the dam shall be denoted by h_max for the maximum height and v_max for the maximum volume. The minimum of the dam shall be h = 0 and v = 0. For our simulation, we'll ignore losses due to leaks or seepage.

To Find the volume of the dam, R was used to build an integration programme $$\h = x^2$$
